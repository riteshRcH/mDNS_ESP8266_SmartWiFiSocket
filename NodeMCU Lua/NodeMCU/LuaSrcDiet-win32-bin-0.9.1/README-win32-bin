DESCRIPTION

LuaSrcDiet.exe is a Win32 binary stand-alone version of LuaSrcDiet.lua.
Note that an executable binary will not allow one to tweak the
LuaSrcDiet script, or to make fixes or add features. But it is
convenient for people who may not have a Lua 5 command-line stand-alone
binary handy.

Please see README for more information on how to use LuaSrcDiet.

For the examples in the README, instead of "lua LuaSrcDiet.lua ..." you
just need to run it as "LuaSrcDiet ...", e.g.

    >LuaSrcDiet --read-only LuaSrcDiet.lua

If you need more than an executable, download the source (script)
distribution.

INTERNALS

LuaSrcDiet.exe is a UPX-compressed executable, actually a very basic
embedding of Lua, which is compiled and linked statically into the
executable itself. The LuaSrcDiet.lua script is embedded as a text
string, which the embedded Lua interpreter will compile and run. It's
kinda a no-brainer implementation of a stand-alone executable of a Lua
script.
